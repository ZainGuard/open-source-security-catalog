# Open Source Security Catalog

> Community-maintained catalog of open-source security tooling and integrations for modern infrastructure.

## 🎯 Mission

This repository serves as a curated, community-driven catalog of open-source security tools that help organizations secure their cloud and infrastructure environments. By maintaining this catalog, we aim to:

- **Promote transparency** through open-source security solutions
- **Reduce costs** by highlighting free and open alternatives to proprietary tools
- **Facilitate discovery** of domain-specific security tools
- **Share knowledge** about tool capabilities, integrations, and deployment patterns
